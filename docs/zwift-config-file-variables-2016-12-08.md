# Zwift config file variables 2016-12-08

## Textures resolution

Sets the resolution/detail of the images that are wrapped around models - buildings, roads, etc.


### Examples

basic, medium, high

```
res 1280x720(0x)
```

ultra

```
res 1920x1080(0x)
```


## Shadow resolution

Sets the resolution of the shadows generated by all objects.
Might be a bit more dependent on CPU than GPU.

Higher numbers increase realism but decrease FPS

### Examples

very low
```
sres 256x256
```

low
```
sres 512x512
```

high
```
sres 1024x1024
```

ultra
```
sres 2048x2048
```

## Screen space ambient occlusion

Enables or disables higher quality lighting & shadows.
The effect is subtle but increases realism dramatically.

Dependent on GPU

On increase realism but decrease FPS


### Examples

On (High and Ultra)

```
set gSSAO=1
```

Off

```
set gSSAO=0
```


## Fast approximate anti-aliasing

Enables or disables smoothing of model edges

On increase realism but decrease FPS

### Examples

On

```
set gFXAA=1
```

Off

```
set gFXAA=0

```

## Frames per second indicator

Show the real-time FPS in top left corner

### Examples

On

```
set gShowFPS=1
```

Off
```
set gShowFPS=0
```


## Sun Rays

Enables or disables fancy sun rays

On increase realism but decrease FPS

### Examples

On

```
set gSunRays=1
```

Off
```
set gSunRays=0
```


## Headlight

Enable headlight on bike

On increase realism but decrease FPS

### Examples

On

```
set gHeadlight=1
```

Off
```
set gHeadlight=0
```

## Foliage Percent

Sets the level of auto-generated scenery - trees, grass, flowers, underwater vegetation, etc.

A number between 0 and 1 is normal

Higher number increases realism but decrease FPS

Examples:
0 = 0%
0.25 = 25%
0.5 = 50%
0.75 = 75%
1 - 100%
5 = 500% - be very careful!


### Examples

low

```
set gFoliagePercent=0.25
```

normal

```
set gFoliagePercent=1
```

extreme

```
set gFoliagePercent=5
```



## Simple Reflections

Enables or disables simple reflections on water, glass, metal, carbon, etc


Off increases realism but decrease FPS

On

```
set gSimpleReflections=1
```

Off

```
set gSimpleReflections=0
```

## Level of detail bias

Not too sure of how this variable works.

Appears to draw models with fewer polygons with higher values

Bike riders look very low fi, and may even vanish when gLODBias=5


### Examples

normal

```
set gLODBias=0
```

low detail

```
set gLODBias=1
```


## Heads Up Display

Enables or disables the heads up display overlays

Set to 0 for making cool videos


### Examples

On (default)

```
set g_bDrawHud=1
```

Off

```
set g_bDrawHud=0
```



## ANISO

Improves the clarity and crispness of textured objects in games

Appears to be deprecated


## Default Configs


### Basic

res 1280x720(0x)

res 1280x720(0x)
sres 1024x1024
aniso 4
set gSSAO=1
set gFXAA=1
set gSimpleReflections=0
```


### Ultra

Put this in the basic.txt or high.txt depending on which profile Zwift gives you by default

(To find out which profile Zwift gives you, drop your log.txt on zwiftalizer.com)

```
res 1920x1080(0x)
sres 2048x2048
set gSSAO=1
set gFXAA=1
set gSimpleReflections=0
set gSunRays=1
set gHeadlight=1
set gFoliagePercent=2
set gLODBias=0
set gShowFPS=1

```

Put this in prefs.config

\Documents\Zwift\prefs.xml


```
<USER_RESOLUTION_PREF>3840Ã—2160</USER_RESOLUTION_PREF>

```
