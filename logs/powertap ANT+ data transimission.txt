Well this got complicated quickly, an ANT+ question to ponder...Some facts ...I see thousands of 'Rx Fail on channel 1' messages every in my logs - 4 per second. Channel 1 is my Powertap pro+ hub.ANT+ can transmit information up to 4 times per second.I never see power dropouts in application.I rarely see 'Rx Fail' for other channels (HR Mon is on channel 2) - so I assume my dongle is receiving strong signals.The Powertap transmits two messages on ANT+1) Power Only Message    - Power    - Cadence2) Torque at Wheel Message    - Torque    - Speed    - Distancethe question is ... could Zwift be not receiving signal 2 (on chan 1) on purpose, because speed is calculated in app?I can't think of another reason for so many 'Rx Fail on channel 1' messages.    Sources https://www.powertap.com/Uploads/PDF/PowerTap-Manuals/slc-plus-manual.pdfhttp://www.slowtwitch.com/Tech/Power_Meter_101_3643.html
